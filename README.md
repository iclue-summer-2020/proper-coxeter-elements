The `data/` folder contains an enumeration of the proper elements for each of
the finite families of the finite Coxeter groups.
Each line is a reduced word.
The contents for `E8` are sharded into files `E8/E8.<length>.out` for each of
the `120` `length`s of reduced words for `E8`.

* Here is the code for the `E8` computation: https://github.com/iclue-summer-2020/coxeter_properness
